Pseudo-Random Generators
========================

In OWASP Secure Coding Practices you'll find what seems to be a really complex
guideline: "_All random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random
strings should be generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s approved random
number generator when these random values are intended to be un-guessable_", so
let's discuss "random numbers".

Cryptography relies on some randomness, but for the sake of correctness, what
most programming languages provide out-of-the-box is a pseudo-random number
generator: for example, [Go's math/rand/v2][1] is not an exception. Note that 
the older `math/rand` is not either a cryptographically secure number generator.

You should carefully read the documentation when it states that "_This package's 
outputs might be easily predictable regardless of how it's seeded_" ([source][2]). 
The `math/rand/v2` package's random values are not as random as values provided 
by `crypto/rand` ([source][3]).

But because we're on Cryptographic Practices section, we
should follow to [Go's crypto/rand package][4].

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math/big"
import "crypto/rand"

func main() {
    rand, err := rand.Int(rand.Reader, big.NewInt(1984))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Random Number: %d\n", rand)
}
```

You may notice that running [crypto/rand][4] is slower than [math/rand/v2][1], but
this is expected since the fastest algorithm isn't always the safest. Crypto's
rand is also safer to implement. An example of this is the fact that you
_CANNOT_ seed `crypto/rand`, since the library uses OS-randomness for this,
preventing developer misuse.

```bash
$ for i in {1..5}; do go run rand-safe.go; done
Random Number: 277
Random Number: 1572
Random Number: 1793
Random Number: 1328
Random Number: 1378
```

If you're curious about how this can be exploited just think what happens if
your application creates a default password on user signup, by computing the
hash of a pseudo-random number generated with the [Go's math/rand][5] package's
now deprecated Seed function.

Yes, you guessed it, you would be able to predict the user's password!
